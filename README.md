# Tic-Tac-Toe-JQuery
Tic-Tac-Toe game written with Jquery

Tic Tac Toe is a game where each player strives to play
three of their own marks horizontally in a row, vertically
in a column, or diagonally across the board.

This version works much the same although the
computer opponent is practically a master, yet one who is 
sensitive to unkind words. If it is taunted, it may become
distracted by any offense taken while making its play.

Likewise, be sure to steel yourself for any sneers thrown
in your direction. Good Luck!

Hints:
Computer may not play well if intimidated.
Intimidated players can't taunt during their turn.
